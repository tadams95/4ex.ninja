## ⚡ **Level 2: Dynamic Risk Management (Automated Adaptive Controls)**

### **🎯 Intelligent Position Sizing Algorithm**

#### **Multi-Factor Position Sizing Framework**
```
Dynamic Position Size Calculation:
Position_Size = Base_Size × Volatility_Factor × Correlation_Factor × Regime_Factor × Stress_Factor

Where:
├── Base_Size = Account_Equity × Strategy_Allocation × Risk_Per_Trade
├── Volatility_Factor = min(1.0, Historical_Volatility / Current_Volatility)
├── Correlation_Factor = max(0.3, 1 - Average_Cross_Correlation)
├── Regime_Factor = Regime_Multiplier[Current_Regime]
└── Stress_Factor = 1 - (Current_Stress_Score / Max_Stress_Score)

Regime Multipliers:
├── Normal Market: 1.0 (full position sizing)
├── Trending Market: 1.2 (increase positions in trend)
├── Ranging Market: 0.8 (reduce positions in chop)
├── High Volatility: 0.6 (significant reduction)
├── Crisis Mode: 0.3 (minimal positions only)
└── Recovery Mode: 0.7 (cautious increase)
```

#### **Real-Time Stress Scoring System**
```
Stress Score Components (0-100 scale):
├── Market Volatility Score (0-30 points)
├── Cross-Asset Correlation Score (0-25 points)
├── News/Event Impact Score (0-20 points)
├── Liquidity Conditions Score (0-15 points)
├── Economic Uncertainty Score (0-10 points)
└── Total Stress Score (0-100)

Stress Level Actions:
├── 0-20: Normal operations (100% position sizing)
├── 21-40: Elevated monitoring (80% position sizing)
├── 41-60: Heightened alert (60% position sizing)
├── 61-80: High stress (40% position sizing)
├── 81-95: Extreme stress (20% position sizing)
└── 96-100: Crisis mode (5% position sizing + emergency protocols)
```

### **📊 Regime-Adaptive Strategy Selection**

#### **Dynamic Strategy Activation Framework**
```
Market Regime Classification:
├── Low Volatility Trending (Activate all 10 strategies)
├── Normal Volatility Ranging (Activate 8 robust strategies)
├── High Volatility Trending (Activate 6 defensive strategies)
├── Extreme Volatility (Activate 3 most conservative strategies)
└── Crisis Mode (Activate 1 survival strategy only)

Strategy Filtering Criteria:
├── Maximum historical drawdown <15%
├── Positive performance in similar market conditions
├── Low correlation with currently active strategies
├── Stress test survival rating >60%
└── Walk-forward validation score >70%
```

#### **Parameter Adaptation Engine**
```
Dynamic Parameter Adjustment:

Moving Average Periods:
├── Normal Markets: Standard periods (20/50, 50/200)
├── Volatile Markets: Responsive periods (15/35, 35/100)
├── Trending Markets: Trend-following periods (25/75, 75/300)
├── Crisis Markets: Stability periods (50/150, 150/500)
└── Recovery Markets: Balanced periods (30/90, 90/270)

Stop Loss Levels:
├── Normal Markets: 2.0% (standard risk)
├── Low Volatility: 1.5% (tight control)
├── High Volatility: 3.0% (noise tolerance)
├── Crisis Markets: 4.0% (survival mode)
└── Recovery Markets: 2.5% (cautious approach)

Signal Confirmation Requirements:
├── Normal: 1 confirmation required
├── Elevated: 2 confirmations required
├── High Stress: 3 confirmations required
├── Crisis: 4+ confirmations required
└── Multiple timeframe confirmation mandatory in crisis
```
