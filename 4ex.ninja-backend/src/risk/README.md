## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Quick Risk Assessment
```python
from src.risk.risk_assessment_integrator import RiskAssessmentIntegrator

integrator = RiskAssessmentIntegrator()
assessment = integrator.run_comprehensive_risk_assessment(
    strategy_name="EUR_USD_H4_Strategy",
    strategy_params=your_strategy_params,
    historical_data=your_historical_data
)
```

### Individual Component Analysis
```python
from src.risk.risk_calculator import RiskCalculator

calculator = RiskCalculator()
risk_results = calculator.calculate_max_drawdown_potential(
    strategy_params, historical_data, n_simulations=100
)
```

## 📊 Assessment Output

The system provides:

### 🔍 **Risk Metrics**
- Value at Risk (95% & 99% confidence levels)
- Maximum drawdown projections
- Position sizing safety analysis
- Risk-reward ratio validation

### ⚠️ **Risk Classification**
- **🟢 LOW RISK** (0-30): Minimal risk, suitable for conservative portfolios
- **🟡 MEDIUM RISK** (31-60): Moderate risk, requires monitoring
- **🟠 HIGH RISK** (61-80): Elevated risk, consider position reduction
- **🔴 CRITICAL RISK** (81-100): Dangerous levels, immediate action required

### 📋 **Actionable Recommendations**
- Prioritized by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Specific parameter adjustments
- Position sizing recommendations
- Market condition adaptations

### 📄 **Automated Reports**
- JSON format for system integration
- Executive summaries for management
- Detailed technical analysis
- Historical comparison tracking
