## üìã What Was Delivered in This Final Sprint

### **üéØ Core Deliverable: SwingBacktestEngine**

Created a production-ready, simplified backtesting framework optimized for swing trading with the following key features:

#### **1. Main Framework Files Created:**
- `4ex.ninja-backend/src/backtesting/swing_backtest_engine.py` - **Core backtesting engine**
- `4ex.ninja-backend/src/backtesting/example_usage.py` - **Usage examples and documentation**
- `4ex.ninja-backend/test_swing_framework.py` - **Validation and testing script**

#### **2. Key Capabilities Implemented:**

**‚úÖ Simple Backtesting:**
- Single strategy, single pair backtesting with regime awareness
- Integration with existing Phase 2 regime detection infrastructure
- Production-ready error handling and logging

**‚úÖ Regime-Based Strategy Optimization:**
- Automatic parameter optimization for each detected market regime
- Multi-parameter combination testing with systematic optimization
- Validation scoring using Sharpe ratio, returns, win rate, and drawdown metrics

**‚úÖ Walk-Forward Analysis:**
- Time-series split validation with configurable windows
- Out-of-sample testing methodology for robust strategy validation
- Combined performance metrics across multiple time periods
- Consistency scoring to identify robust strategies

**‚úÖ Production Integration:**
- Compatible with existing `BaseStrategy` interface
- Leverages existing regime detection and data infrastructure
- Configurable risk management and position sizing
- Comprehensive result tracking and regime performance attribution
