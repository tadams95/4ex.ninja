# Modern Moving Average Backtesting Framework
## Enterprise-Grade Forex Analysis System Development Plan

## Critical Assessment of Current State

### Fundamental Issues Requiring Resolution

The existing performance analysis contains significant gaps that undermine confidence in strategy effectiveness. Historical backtesting predates the Redis optimization infrastructure, making performance metrics essentially obsolete. Current parameter configurations in production differ substantially from tested combinations, creating an unknown performance profile. The unified strategy architecture has never been comprehensively validated against the individual strategies it replaced.

Infrastructure improvements including incremental processing, comprehensive error handling, and multi-tier notification systems have introduced performance characteristics that remain unmeasured. Without fresh validation, the system operates on outdated assumptions about signal quality, timing, and delivery performance.
