**Current Performance Issues**:
- 200-candle fetches every signal cycle (unnecessary data retrieval)
- Blocking Discord API calls causing 2-5s latency
- No incremental processing or caching layer
- 90% of database queries are redundant

**Target Performance Improvements**:

      async def process_notification_queue(self)  # Background worker
      async def send_with_retry(self, notification: Notification, max_retries: int = 3)
  ```
  - Replace `requests.post()` calls with `aiohttp` async HTTP client
  - Implement notification queue with priority routing (URGENT/HIGH/NORMAL/LOW)

## 🏗️ **DIGITAL OCEAN INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Current Infrastructure Status ✅**
- ✅ **Docker Compose Production Setup**: Complete with nginx, FastAPI, Next.js, MongoDB, Redis
- ✅ **SSL/HTTPS Configuration**: Let's Encrypt certificates with auto-renewal
- ✅ **Redis Caching Layer**: Installed and operational for signal optimization
- ✅ **Rate Limiting & Security**: Comprehensive nginx security headers and rate limiting
- ✅ **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus & Grafana available for system monitoring

### **WebSocket Infrastructure Requirements 🔄**

#### **REQUIRED: Nginx Configuration Updates**
- [ ] **Add WebSocket Location Block** to `/nginx/4ex-ninja.conf`:
  ```nginx
  # Add under API server block (api.4ex.ninja)
  location /ws/ {
      proxy_pass http://backend;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
      
      # WebSocket specific timeouts (24 hour connections)
      proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
      proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
      proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
      
      # Disable buffering for real-time communication
      proxy_buffering off;
      proxy_cache off;
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Update Content Security Policy** in both server blocks:
  ```nginx
  # Current CSP line (around line 173):
  # connect-src 'self' *.stripe.com wss: ws: api.4ex.ninja
  
  # Update to:
  connect-src 'self' *.stripe.com wss://api.4ex.ninja wss://4ex.ninja ws: wss: api.4ex.ninja
  ```

#### **REQUIRED: Docker Compose Environment Variables**
- [ ] **Add to `docker-compose.prod.yml` backend environment**:
  ```yaml
  environment:
    # ... existing variables ...
    - WEBSOCKET_ENABLED=true
    - WEBSOCKET_MAX_CONNECTIONS=1000
    - WEBSOCKET_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=300
    - WEBSOCKET_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30
    - WEBSOCKET_REDIS_PREFIX=ws_sessions
  ```

#### **OPTIONAL: Enhanced Monitoring**
- [ ] **WebSocket Metrics Integration**:
  ```python
  # Add to existing real_time_monitor.py
  websocket_metrics = {
      "active_connections": await websocket_bridge.get_connection_count(),
      "messages_per_minute": await websocket_bridge.get_message_rate(),
      "connection_success_rate": await websocket_bridge.get_success_rate(),
      "average_latency_ms": await websocket_bridge.get_avg_latency()
  }
  ```

### **Token Launch Infrastructure Preparation 🪙**

#### **Week 11-12: Wallet Infrastructure Readiness**
- [ ] **Environment Variables for Token Integration**:
  ```yaml
  # Add to docker-compose.prod.yml
  - TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=  # Set after Clanker deployment
  - BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
  - BASE_CHAIN_ID=8453
  - TOKEN_CACHE_TTL=300  # 5 minutes
  - WALLET_SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600  # 1 hour
  ```

- [ ] **Redis Memory Optimization**:
  ```bash
  # Update Redis container configuration for token balance caching
  # Current setup handles this automatically with existing memory allocation
  # Monitor and scale if needed during token launch
  ```

#### **Week 13-16: Production Token Launch**
- [ ] **Load Balancer Configuration** (if needed for high traffic):
  ```yaml
  # Digital Ocean Load Balancer settings
  # WebSocket sticky sessions: enabled
  # Health checks: /health endpoint
  # SSL passthrough: disabled (nginx handles SSL)
  ```

### **Deployment Checklist 📋**

#### **Before WebSocket Deployment**
- [ ] Backup current nginx configuration
- [ ] Test nginx configuration changes in staging
- [ ] Prepare rollback scripts
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window (if needed)

#### **During WebSocket Deployment**
