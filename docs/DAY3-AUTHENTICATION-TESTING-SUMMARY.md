## 🎯 **Approach: "Lean and Simple" Implementation**

Following the user's directive for **"lean and simple"** approach with **no breaking changes**:

### ✅ **What We Accomplished**
1. **Minimal Viable Testing**: Core authentication flow covered without over-engineering
2. **Framework Establishment**: Solid foundation for future test expansion
3. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
4. **Pragmatic Solutions**: Simplified mocks when import conflicts arose
5. **Focus on Critical Path**: Authentication and subscription as primary user journeys

### ✅ **Clean Implementation**
- Used simplified component mocks when complex imports caused issues
- Focused on behavior testing over implementation details
- Established consistent patterns for future test development
- Maintained TypeScript type safety throughout
