Level 4 (>15%): Emergency Stop - Close 50% positions + complete halt
```

#### **Volatility Controls**
```
Normal (1x): Standard Operations - 100% position sizing
Elevated (1.5x): Cautious Mode - 80% position sizing + stricter filters
High (2x): Defensive Mode - 60% position sizing + 30s monitoring
Extreme (3x): Emergency Mode - 30% position sizing + real-time monitoring
```

#### **Value-at-Risk (VaR) Controls**
```
Green Zone (<0.1%): Normal operations
Yellow Zone (0.1%-0.2%): Enhanced monitoring + minor reductions
Orange Zone (0.2%-0.4%): Risk action required + significant reductions
Red Zone (>0.4%): Emergency procedures + severe restrictions
```

### **✅ Emergency Trigger Specifications**
```
Trigger 1: Portfolio Drawdown >15% → Close 50% positions (<60s)
Trigger 2: VaR Breach >0.5% → Halt all trading (<30s)
