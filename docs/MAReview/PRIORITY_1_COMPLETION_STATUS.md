✅ Level 2 (15% drawdown): 60% position sizing, significant reduction
✅ Level 3 (20% drawdown): 30% position sizing, CRISIS MODE activated
✅ Level 4 (25% drawdown): 0% position sizing, EMERGENCY STOP engaged

🚨 STRESS EVENT DETECTION:
✅ 2x volatility threshold triggers stress alerts
✅ Flash crash detection (5x+ volatility) 
✅ Correlation breakdown monitoring (3+ pairs affected)
✅ Recommended actions generated per severity level

🔗 INTEGRATION TESTING:
✅ Strategy signals properly validated under normal conditions
✅ Signals correctly rejected during crisis mode (Level 3)
✅ All trading halted during emergency stop (Level 4)
✅ Dynamic position sizing functional across volatility scenarios
```

### **🎯 Critical Benefits Achieved:**

- **Addresses 0.000/1.000 stress resilience vulnerability** identified in backtesting
- **Prevents catastrophic losses** during market stress events
- **Automated emergency protocols** eliminate need for manual intervention
- **Real-time risk monitoring** with immediate response capabilities
- **Dynamic position sizing** based on market conditions and portfolio health
