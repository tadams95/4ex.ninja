📋 COMPREHENSIVE TASK PROMPT
Context: You are implementing the final component of Phase 2's Portfolio Correlation Management system for the 4ex.ninja trading platform. The real-time correlation calculation, breach detection, and position rebalancing are already complete and deployed to production. Now you need to implement the Correlation Trend Analysis component.

Current Status:

✅ Real-time correlation monitoring operational (60-day rolling windows)
✅ Correlation breach detection working (0.35 early warning, 0.4 breach)
✅ Dynamic position rebalancing integrated with emergency protocols
✅ COMPLETED: Historical correlation pattern analysis and trend prediction
Your Task: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement a comprehensive Correlation Trend Analysis system that provides:

✅ Historical Pattern Analysis - Identify correlation drift patterns over time
✅ Predictive Modeling - Forecast correlation movements toward breach thresholds
✅ Market Regime Adjustments - Adapt correlation expectations based on market conditions


🎯 SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
✅ Backend Components Built:
✅ Correlation Trend Calculator

✅ class CorrelationTrendAnalyzer:
    """
    Analyze correlation trends and predict future movements
    Target: Predict correlation breaches 1-3 days in advance
    """
    
    ✅ def calculate_correlation_trends(self, lookback_days: int = 90) -> Dict
    ✅ def predict_correlation_movement(self, pair: str, forecast_days: int = 3) -> Dict
    ✅ def detect_regime_shifts(self) -> Dict
    ✅ def generate_trend_alerts(self) -> List[Dict]

✅ API Endpoints Created:

✅ /api/risk/correlation-trends - Historical trend data
✅ /api/risk/correlation-forecast - Predictive analysis
✅ /api/risk/correlation-regime - Market regime analysis

✅ Frontend Components Built:
✅ CorrelationTrends.tsx Component

✅ 30-day correlation trend charts for each pair
✅ Trend direction indicators (↗️ increasing, ↘️ decreasing, ➡️ stable)
✅ Breach prediction alerts (trending toward 0.4 threshold)
✅ Market regime indicators
✅ Dashboard Integration

✅ Add to RiskDashboard.tsx in the secondary grid
✅ Replace placeholder with functional trend analysis
✅ Real-time updates every 30 seconds

📊 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Data Requirements:
Historical Window: 90-day correlation history for trend analysis
Prediction Horizon: 1-3 day correlation forecasts
Update Frequency: Recalculate trends every 5 minutes
Breach Threshold: Predict when correlation will exceed 0.35 (early warning)
Algorithmic Approach:
Trend Detection: Use linear regression on 30-day rolling correlations
Volatility Analysis: Calculate correlation volatility to assess stability
Regime Detection: Identify market stress periods with elevated correlations
Prediction Model: Time-series forecasting (ARIMA or exponential smoothing)
Visual Design:
Trend Charts: Line charts showing 30-day correlation trends per pair
Direction Arrows: Visual indicators for correlation direction
Prediction Zones: Shaded areas showing forecast ranges
Alert Badges: Warning indicators for pairs trending toward breach
