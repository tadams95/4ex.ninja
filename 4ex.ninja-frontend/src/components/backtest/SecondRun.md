## Risk Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Note**: While updating to show 100% profitable pairs, we must prominently display the confidence analysis findings that suggest 48-52% win rates in live trading due to:

- Spread costs not modeled in backtest
- Slippage and execution delays
- Market regime dependencies
- Psychological factors in live trading
