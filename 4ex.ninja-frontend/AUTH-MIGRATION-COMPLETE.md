## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users

## Next Steps

3. **Update any remaining auth-gated features** to use wallet connection state
4. **Test mobile responsiveness** with new navigation

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

The header now features a clean, modern design with wallet-based authentication as the primary (and only) authentication method. Users can access all features simply by connecting their wallet, providing a seamless Web3 experience that aligns with modern dApp standards.

The traditional login/signup flow has been completely replaced with OnchainKit's professional wallet connection system.
