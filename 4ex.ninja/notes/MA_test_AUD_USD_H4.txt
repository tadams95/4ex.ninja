Key Findings
Risk/Reward Profile: Slower MA (160,50) shows best risk-adjusted returns with highest Sharpe ratio

Trade Frequency: Faster MA (20,10) provides more opportunities but requires tighter risk management

Position Size: Consider larger positions for slower MA due to better metrics and lower drawdown

Win Rate: All combinations show win rates below 50%, but profit factors above 1 indicate profitable strategies

Recommendation
For most traders, the (160,50) combination offers the best balance of risk and reward,
despite lower total pips.
 The higher Sharpe ratio and lower drawdown make it more sustainable for long-term trading.
